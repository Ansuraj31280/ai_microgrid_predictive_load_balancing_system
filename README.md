# AI Microgrid Predictive Load Balancing System

**Final Project Grade:** Full-Stack MLOps

This project demonstrates a production-ready **Digital Twin** system that integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Optimization** to proactively manage power consumption on embedded hardware. It bridges **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** hardware design with modern **MLOps deployment** practices.

## 1. The Challenge (Situation & Task)

### Problem Gap
In smart home and microgrid applications, power control is typically reactive—responding only after overloads occur. This results in wasted energy, increased peak-hour costs, and system instability.

The objective was to develop a **distributed AI system** that performs **predictive load balancing** and **optimized control**, utilizing simple edge hardware for execution.

### Quantifiable Achievement
- Designed an **ESP12F PCB Actuator** for load switching.
- Deployed a **Dockerized LSTM** and **Linear Programming (LP) Solver** via **FastAPI** to manage grid stability.
- Achieved **0.0335 Test RMSE** on load prediction.
- Enabled a **25% projected reduction in peak-hour energy costs** through proactive load balancing.

## 2. The Solution (Action)

The system follows a **Hybrid Edge-Cloud Architecture** composed of three decoupled microservices.

### A. The Edge Layer (Custom Hardware – ECE)
**Component:** Custom-designed ESP12F 4-Relay PCB (Digital Twin).  
**Function:**  
- Acts as the actuator.  
- Sends real-time load telemetry data via HTTP POST.  
- Receives optimized action commands (e.g., “Toggle Relay 3 OFF”) from the central API.  

**Files:** `esp_simulator.py` (simulates hardware behavior and fault resilience).

---

### B. The Brain Layer (FastAPI MLOps Microservice)
**Component:** High-performance REST API built using **FastAPI** and containerized via **Docker**.  
**Function:**  
- **Prediction:** Uses a trained LSTM model (`lstm_forecaster.h5`) to forecast power demand 60 minutes ahead.  
- **Optimization:** Employs a **Linear Programming Solver (PuLP)** to minimize relay switching while avoiding predicted peaks.  
- **Serving:** Exposes endpoints for actuator control such as `/api/v1/control/optimize`.

**Files:** `src/main.py`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`.

---

### C. The Visualization Layer (Monitoring)
**Component:** Real-time dashboard built using **Streamlit** and **Plotly**.  
**Function:**  
- Consumes the FastAPI metrics endpoint `/api/v1/dashboard/metrics`.  
- Visualizes **Predicted Load vs. Critical Threshold** and logs all optimization events.  

**Files:** `src/dashboard.py`.

## 3. The Result (Demonstration & Impact)

| Feature | Technical Proof | Business Impact |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Prediction Accuracy** | LSTM achieved **0.0335 Test RMSE** on unseen data. | Enables reliable forecasting for proactive load management. |
| **System Resilience** | Hybrid Edge/Cloud Failsafe: defaults to safe “No Action” mode on API failure. | Guarantees reliability and hardware safety, aligning with ECE standards. |
| **Load Balancing** | PuLP solver dynamically prioritizes relays based on predicted peaks. | 25% projected energy cost reduction through optimal scheduling. |
| **Deployment & Visualization** | Fully containerized with real-time dashboard visualization. | Demonstrates end-to-end production-grade implementation. |
